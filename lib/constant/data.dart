        '''President Ramchandra Paudel on Wednesday addressed a special ceremony held at Sheetal Niwas on the occasion of Constitution Day.

During the ceremony, Paudel expressed his heartfelt tribute towards martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the establishment of a democratic republic and acknowledged the contribution of senior leaders of democratic movements.

The President stated that while changes had been brought to the system, the condition of the country, society and the general public had yet to be transformed.

“Undoubtedly, we have restructured the state administratively and the state power too has reached to the access of the people at the most grassroots level. But, the character of the State is yet to be reformed and restructured.”

Paudel also expressed that although republic had been attained, he felt as though its true meaning was yet to be understood and internalised.

Republic does not simply mean the change of guards in the governance structure, the President said. “It still remains for us to properly understand that the republic is the system that not only ensures people’s direct participation in the political process, that leads them to state power, but also expects people to transform their conduct in accordance with the spirit of the system.”

The President opined that while Nepal, as a nation, had abundant opportunities before itself, their realisation would only be possible if relentless work was put into bringing drastic and righteous changes in the conduct and character in accordance with the democratic culture.

There is no alternative to moving ahead, protecting the constitution and safeguarding political achievements, he added.

Paudel also stressed the need to improve the mode of governance and enhance international engagements— bilateral and multilateral— in order to strengthen the national economy.

“As the country faces headwinds at the moment, we are required to enhance our international engagements as well, through balanced and effective foreign policy. Such endeavours are imperative also for strengthening the national economy as we need to generate income and employment opportunities for our young human resources.”

        '''A group of Nepali Congress dissidents led by senior leader Shekhar Koirala met party president Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday on the eve of the party’s Central Working Committee meeting, and pressed him to correct the course or face consequences.

This sets the stage for a showdown at the Central Working Committee meeting, which is starting Thursday. The Koirala camp is preparing to attack Deuba on several issues related to party affairs including unconstitutional attempts to form government in Koshi province, and alleged poor performance of the Maoist Centre-led coalition government, of which the Congress is a partner, among other things.

Before meeting Deuba, the Koirala camp on Tuesday held a gathering of its group and discussed its agenda for the upcoming meeting. As per the gathering’s decision, Koirala, law minister and party vice president Dhanraj Gurung, and others had reached Deuba’s residence and expressed their strong displeasure at his alleged attempts to run the party unilaterally and demanded that he correct his working style.

On Tuesday, during a separate gathering called by party general secretary Gagan Thapa and senior leader Koirala, the dissident camp unanimously agreed that the government had failed to cater to people’s aspirations. Leaders said they may ask the party to seek alternatives to the current Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government if it continues to fail to meet people’s aspirations.

Some senior leaders of the Koirala-Thapa camp, including party vice-president Dhanraj Gurung, Minendra Rijal, Dilendra Badu, Krishna Chandra Nepali, Badri Pandey and Chandra Bhandari were present at Tuesday’s meeting.

“Our functioning is chaotic, sister organisations are dysfunctional, and different districts are reporting disarray in party organisation,” said Gurung who had accompanied Koirala and other leaders.

“The party should be run as per the charter. The central working committee is yet to get a full shape, and several party committees and departments are yet to be formed. The party’s unconstitutional decisions in its attempt to form a government in Koshi Province have sent a very negative message to the public,” said Gurung.

At the meeting on Wednesday, Koirala stated that Deuba has been running the party unilaterally, there is no transparency in decision-making, the party charter has been ignored and no discussions or debates are held on vital issues related to national politics and governance.

“Your decisions are irrational and have harmed the party’s image. Congress representatives in the central and provincial governments have failed to work for people’s good. All these issues need serious discussion in the party, or else, we will be forced to seek alternatives,” Koirala told Deuba, according to a Congress leader.

Koirala also expressed his displeasure at Deuba’s selection of the party’s ministerial candidates without consulting the party, the unconstitutional tactic used by the party in an attempt to form government in the Koshi province, and haphazard formation and restructuring of the party's sister wings, among other things.

“The party’s attempt to form a government in Koshi through unconstitutional means has tarnished the party’s image,” Koirala told Deuba, according to the leader.

    "noticeDescription":
        '''Until a few weeks back, the government and the ruling parties appeared to show a sense of urgency towards finalising the amendment bill on the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act. While the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives was in intense discussion, a series of talks were held among the top leaders of the major parties.

The ruling alliance, particularly Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and his party CPN (Maoist Centre), had expedited negotiations as he, through the ongoing UN General Assembly meeting, wanted to give a message to the world that Nepal had amended the Act and was on course to conclude the transitional justice process soon.

However, with no sign of the bill’s endorsement before Dahal embarked on a journey to New York, the government’s efforts slowed down. And ever since the demise of Constituent Assembly chair and CPN-UML vice-chair Subas Chandra Nembang on September 12, there has been no discussion to finalise the bill. The sub-panel under the House committee which, on September 5, got a third one-week extension to finalise the bill, has yet to commence its work during this extended term.

“Not a single formal meeting has been held since the sub-committee got the latest extension,” Adhiraj Rai, secretary of the House Committee, told the Post. “As far as I know, there has as yet been no formal agreement among the parties.”

Lawmakers from various parties had reached a broad understanding on giving four years to the two transitional justice commissions—Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and Commission on the Investigation of Enforced Disappeared Persons—to complete their job, own up all complaints including those registered at the human rights committee of the United Nations and the National Human Rights Commission, among others.

“Though negotiations among different parties are heading in the right direction, there has been no agreement. Now it has been days we haven’t met,” Mahesh Bartaula, a UML whip who also is a member of the sub-panel, told the Post. “The ruling alliance hasn’t shown the urgency.”

Dahal left for New York on Saturday and is scheduled to address the general assembly on September 21, before embarking on a China visit from there. Bartaula said so far the sub-committee has held discussions with insurgency victims, human rights activists and lawmakers who have registered amendments to the bill.
